# What does this extension do?

Dramatically improves Terraform Syntax Highlighting support (0.12 now supported!).

There are "Textmate Scopes" that your theme uses to apply syntax highlighting, and this extension improves these scopes, while adding some additional scopes to ultimately improve your syntax highlighting.

## How do you use it?

Most themes are supported by default. Just install this VS Code extension and you'll immediately notice improved syntax highlighting for your Terraform files.

Want to have even further granularity with your syntax highlighting? Take a look at the following guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide.
